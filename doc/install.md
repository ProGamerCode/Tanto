##### 1. Application server requirements

- nodejs version 6.9.1-v.7.0
- npm version >= 3.10.8
- yarn (npm install yarn -g)
- forever (npm install forever -g)
- nginx
- redis (local or remote)

The application uses Redis db to store session, if you can't connect to any Redis instance, please setup local one. Familiarize yourself with the installation guide http://redis.io/topics/quickstart.

You might run it with `docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis `

##### 2. Enable environment variables file:
Rename/copy file  `.env.example` to `.env` and provide variables if needed.

- provide ***REDIS_HOST, REDIS_PORT*** if they differ from default ones

- the application uses SLACK Web API to fetch user's avatars. Make sure you provide ***SLACK_TOKEN*** in `.env` file

To obtain slack token for development and testing visit page https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-test-tokens, login with your slack account and issue your personal token following the instructions.

- Application authenticates user with Ono OAuth2 API and requires authentication API host and user info route

- Application exposes ONO GraphQL API and requires ***ONO_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID*** and ***ONO_OAUTH_SECRET_ID***


##### 3. Run/Restart application(production)

If node process is already run you can simply run

`yarn restart`

Check if process restarted correctly and there are no errors. Done.

But if node process is not running, do the following(or run npm command shortcuts from package.json):

`git checkout -f master`
`git pull`
`yarn`
`yarn run build`
`yarn start`

Forever docs:
https://github.com/foreverjs/forever

The node process will be started on the port defined by node PORT environment variable, can be changed in package.json.


##### 4. NGINX

*[THIS step should be done only once]* Add NGINX config that proxy port 80 to node process port. Make sure nginx listens correct port.

Example:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name tanto.hq.unity3d.com;

    location / {
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header   Host $http_host;
        proxy_pass         "http://127.0.0.1:8080";
    }
}
```

##### 5. Development environment

- Run development server:
`yarn run dev`

 - Run unit tests:
`yarn test`
